# Code of conduct

Strata is a correctness-first project with strict technical guarantees. That only works if the community operates with the same level of clarity, respect, and professionalism.

This Code of Conduct defines the expectations for everyone participating in the project.



***

### Our commitment

We are committed to providing a welcoming, professional, and harassment-free environment for all contributors and users.

Participation in Strata is open regardless of:

* experience level
* background
* nationality
* personal identity
* opinions, as long as they are expressed respectfully

Technical disagreement is expected. Disrespect is not.



***

### Expected behavior

All participants are expected to:

* Be respectful and considerate in communication
* Focus criticism on ideas, code, and design, not people
* Accept feedback in good faith
* Take responsibility for mistakes
* Prioritize the long-term health of the project

Clear disagreement is allowed. Personal attacks are not.



***

### Unacceptable behavior

The following behaviors are not tolerated:

* Harassment, intimidation, or threats
* Personal insults or derogatory language
* Trolling or bad-faith participation
* Publishing private information without consent
* Persistent disruption of discussions
* Attempts to bypass project rules or governance

This applies to all project spaces, including issues, pull requests, discussions, and external representations of the project.



***

### Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for enforcing this Code of Conduct.

If unacceptable behavior occurs, maintainers may take action including:

* Requesting changes in behavior
* Issuing warnings
* Temporarily restricting participation
* Permanently banning contributors in severe cases

Actions will be proportional and focused on protecting the project and its participants.



***

### Reporting issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

* Report it privately to the project maintainers
* Include relevant context where possible
* Reports will be handled confidentially and seriously

Retaliation for reporting is itself a violation.



***

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:

* All repository activity
* All official communication channels
* Any situation where someone is representing Strata publicly



***

### Final note

Strata enforces strict rules at the technical level. The community should reflect the same discipline socially.

Be precise. Be respectful. Be professional.

Correctness is not just a property of code.
